        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Personal data (hereinafter mostly referred to as &quot;data&quot;) is processed by us only within the scope of necessity and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly Internet presence, including its contents and the services offered there.</p>
        <p>Pursuant to Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the basic Regulation on data protection (hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;DSGVO&#x27;), &#x27;processing&#x27; means any operation or set of operations relating to personal data, such as collection, recording, organisation, sorting, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, comparison or association, limitation, erasure or destruction, carried out with or without the aid of automated processes.</p>
        <p>With the following data protection declaration we inform you in particular about type, extent, purpose, duration and legal basis of the processing of personal data, as far as we decide either alone or together with others about the purposes and means of the processing. In addition, we will inform you below about the third-party components used by us for optimisation purposes and to increase the quality of use, insofar as third parties process data on their own responsibility.</p>
        <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
        <p>I. Information about us as responsible<br>II. Contact details of the Data Protection Officer<br>III. Rights of users and affected<br>IV. Information on data processing</p>
        <p><strong>I. Information about us as responsible persons</strong></p>
        <p>Responsible provider of this website in the sense of data protection:</p>
        <p>NOKERA AG<br>Hardenbergstraße 28a<br>10623 Berlin<br>Deutschland</p>
        <p>Legally represented by its Management Board, Messrs Jan Hedding and Ralf Gaiser</p>
        <p>Tel. +49 (0) 30 241 89 88 0</p>
        <p>Fax +49 (0) 30 241 89 88 99</p>
        <p>E-Mail: info@nokera.com</p>
        <p><strong>II. Contact details of the Data Protection Officer</strong></p>
        <p>The company data protection officer is Mr. Thoralf S. Thorson. He is available at the address above or at:<br>
          <a href="http://about:blank">datenschutz@gateway-re.de</a>
        </p>
        <p><strong>III. Rights of users and data subjects</strong></p>
        <p>With regard to the data processing described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right to</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>to confirmation within the meaning of Art. 15 DSGVO whether data relating to them will be processed, to information on the data processed, to further information on the data processing and to copies of the data;</li>
          <li>to correct or complete inaccurate or incomplete data within the framework of Art. 16 DSGVO;</li>
          <li>to the immediate deletion of the data concerning them within the framework of Art. 17 DSGVO;</li>
          <li>restriction of processing in accordance with Art. 18 DSGVO;</li>
          <li>to receive the data concerning them and provided by them and to transfer these data to other providers/responsible persons within the framework of Art. 20 DSGVO, if the processing is based on a consent or a contract and the processing is carried out by means of automated procedures;</li>
          <li>on complaint to the supervisory authority if they are of the opinion that the data concerning them are being processed by the provider in breach of data protection provisions (cf. also Art. 77 DSGVO).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the provider is obliged to inform all recipients to whom data have been disclosed by the provider of any rectification or deletion of data or of the restriction of processing which takes place pursuant to Articles 16, 17 para. 1, 18 DSGVO. However, this obligation does not exist if this notification is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Irrespective of this, the user has a right to information about these recipients.</p>
        <p><strong>Users and data subjects also have the right under Art. 21 DSGVO to object to the future processing of data concerning them, provided that the data are processed by the provider in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. The controller will then examine whether he can establish compelling legitimate reasons for the processing, overriding the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or whether the processing is conducive to the assertion, exercise or defence of rights. In such a case, the controller may proceed with the processing. Furthermore, an objection against data processing for the purpose of direct marketing is admissible without the responsible party being able to examine the individual case in the aforementioned sense.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>IV. Information on data processing</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Server data</strong></p>
        <p>For technical reasons, in particular to ensure a secure and stable internet presence, data is sent to us or to our web space provider by your internet browser.</p>
        <p>QiTEC IT Service GmbH<br>Täubchenweg 8<br>04317 Leipzig<br>Germany</p>
        <p>who works for us as an order processor. With these so-called server log files, the type and version of your internet browser, the operating system, the website from which you switched to our internet presence (referrer URL), the website(s) of our internet presence that you visit, the date and time of the respective access and the IP address of the internet connection from which the use of our internet presence takes place are collected.</p>
        <p>These data collected in this way are temporarily stored, but not together with other data from you.</p>
        <p>This storage takes place on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) DSGVO (balancing of interests). Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality and security of our internet presence as well as in the provision of the contents of the website accessed by the user.</p>
        <p>The data will be deleted after seven days at the latest, unless further storage is necessary for evidence purposes. Otherwise, the data shall be wholly or partially excluded from erasure until the incident has been finally resolved.</p>
        <p>There is no obligation to provide the data, but if the data is not provided, we will not be able to provide the content accessed on the website.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p><strong>a) Description and scope of data processing</strong></p>
        <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;). Google Analytics uses &quot;cookies&quot;, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.</p>
        <p>However, if IP anonymization is enabled on this website, Google will previously truncate your IP address within member states of the European Union or other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.</p>
        <p>On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google.</p>
        <p><br><strong>b) Legal basis for data processing </strong></p>
        <p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The<br> legal basis for the processing of personal data using technically necessary cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies for analysis purposes is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO if the user has given his consent.<br><br><strong>c) Purpose of data processing</strong></p>
        <p>The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to simplify the use of websites for users. Some functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For these it is necessary that the browser is recognized also after a page change.</p>
        <p>We need cookies for the following applications:</p>
        <p>(1) Google Analytics Tracking</p>
        <p>The user data collected by technically necessary cookies are not used to create user profiles.</p>
        <p>The analysis cookies are used for the purpose of improving the quality of our website and its content. Through the analysis cookies, we learn how the website is used and can thus constantly optimize our offer.</p>
        <p>In these purposes also our legitimate interest lies in the processing of personal data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.</p>
        <p><strong>(e) duration of storage, possibility of objection and removal</strong></p>
        <p>Cookies are stored on the user&#x27;s computer and transmitted to our site by the user. Therefore, you as a user also have full control over the use of cookies. You can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it is possible that not all functions of the website can be used to the full extent.</p>
        <p>The transmission of Flash cookies cannot be prevented via the browser settings, but by changing the settings of the Flash Player.</p>
        <p><strong>Newsletter</strong></p>
        <p>If you register for our free newsletter, the data requested from you for this purpose, i.e. your e-mail address and - optionally - your name and address, will be transmitted to us. At the same time, we store the IP address of the Internet connection from which you access our website as well as the date and time of your registration. As part of the further registration process, we will obtain confirmation of your consent to the sending of the newsletter (double opt-in), specifically describe the content and refer to this privacy policy. The data collected will be used exclusively for sending the newsletter.</p>
        <p>The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) DSGVO (consent).</p>
        <p>In accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 DSGVO, you may revoke your consent to receive the newsletter at any time with effect for the future. All you have to do is inform us of your revocation or click on the unsubscribe link contained in each newsletter.</p>
        <p><strong>Contact enquiries / Contact possibility</strong></p>
        <p>If you contact us by e-mail, the data you provide will be used to process your enquiry. The data must be provided in order to process and respond to your enquiry - we cannot answer your enquiry without providing it, or only to a limited extent if necessary.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) DSGVO (contract initiation or contract execution). If you act for a company or if the subject of your inquiry is not the initiation of a contractual relationship between you and us, the legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest in the processing of the concern of this company communicated by you or the processing and answering of your other concern (Art. 6 Para. 1 Sentence 1 lit. f) DSGVO).</p>
        <p>Your data will be deleted if your request has been answered conclusively and if there are no legal obligations to retain data to prevent deletion, such as for example in the case of any subsequent processing of a contract.</p>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Plug-ins</strong></p>
        <p>We have included third-party plug-ins on the website that allow you to use the functionality offered on the website by third-party vendors.</p>
        <p>We use a plug-in on this page to display selected stock exchange prices. This plug-in is offered by EQS Group AG.</p>
        <p>When calling up the respective pages used by the plug-in, the provider of the plug-in (comparable to calling up an external website via a link) can in particular process your IP address and the address (URL). In addition, the provider of the plug-in may receive information from any cookies stored in your Internet browser of the respective provider. The provider of the plug-in can therefore at least receive the information that our website was accessed under the IP address assigned to you at the time of accessing the page with the plug-in.</p>
        <p>If you are registered with EQS Group AG as a user, this provider can usually also assign the data received to your user account via the plug-in. We would like to point out that we have no knowledge of the concrete data collected by EQS Group AG.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we have no knowledge of the specific purposes of the processing of the data collected by EQS Group AG or of further details of the data processing of this provider. In particular, we do not know whether EQS Group AG processes the data collected solely to provide the functionality of the plug-in (e.g. for sharing certain content or submitting a comment) or for other purposes (e.g. to create user profiles or personalise advertising).</p>
